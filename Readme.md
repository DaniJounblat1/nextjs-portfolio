## Introduction

This portfolio website is a personal project that showcases my work and skills as a developer. The entire site was developed using an Android phone with Termux and Acode editor, demonstrating that it's possible to create a professional web presence with minimal resources. Despite having no prior knowledge of frameworks, I utilized Next.js 12 to build this site.
